This command prints shell code which must be evaluated
to provide interactive completion of gojira commands.

Usage:
  gojira completion SHELL [flags]

Examples:
  # Generate the gojira completion code for bash
  gojira completion bash > bash_completion.sh
  source bash_completion.sh
  
  # The above example depends on the bash-completion framework.
  # It must be sourced before sourcing the gojira completion,
  # i.e. on the Mac:
  
  brew install bash-completion
  source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
  gojira completion bash > bash_completion.sh
  source bash_completion.sh
  
  # In zsh*, the following will load gojira cli zsh completion:
  source <(gojira completion zsh)
  
  * zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
