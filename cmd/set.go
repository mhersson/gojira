Setting an issue as active does not change the status of the issue in JIRA, it
just tells Gojira that this is your active issue, the one you are currently
working on. Setting an issue as active removes the need of specifying an
issueKey with (almost) every command

The same goes for setting a board as active. It marks the given board as your
board of interest, and will be used by the get sprint command when no other board
name is specified
Usage:
  gojira set active [issue|board] [ISSUE KEY|BOARD NAME] [flags]

Aliases:
  active, a

Flags:
  -h, --help                   help for comment
