# Aliases is a key value map where one can configure aliases for often used
# issues keys for time reporting. E.g if you have a special issue key used for
# registering internal meetings, then you could create an alias like m1 to point to
# that issue key, and then write something like `gojira add work m1 1h ...`
# when registering hours on that ticket

aliases:
  m1: <meeting issue key>
  t1: <issue key>
